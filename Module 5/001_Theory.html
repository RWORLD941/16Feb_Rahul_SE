    <H3>1. Website</H3> 
    <p>A website is a collection of related web pages typically served from a single web domain. It can
    include a variety of content types such as text, images, videos, and interactive elements. Websites are accessed via
    the internet using a web browser.</p>

    <h3>2. Webpage</h3> 
    <p>A webpage is a single document on the World Wide Web that can be accessed through a web browser. It
    may contain various types of content, including text, images, multimedia elements, hyperlinks, and interactive
    features. Webpages are typically written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and styled with CSS (Cascading Style
    Sheets).</p>

    <h3>3. Web browser</h3> 
    <p>A web browser is a software application used to access, retrieve, and display information on the
    World Wide Web. Examples of web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari, and Opera.
    Web browsers interpret HTML documents, CSS stylesheets, and execute scripts to render webpages correctly for users.</p>

    <h3>4. Web server</h3> <p>A web server is a computer program or a hardware device that serves content to clients over the
    HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or its secure variant, HTTPS. Web servers store, process, and deliver webpages
    and other web resources to users upon request. Examples of web server software include Apache HTTP Server, Nginx,
    Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), and LiteSpeed.</p>

    <h3>5. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</h3> <p>HTML is the standard markup language used to create and structure content
    on webpages. It consists of a series of elements and tags that define the structure and semantics of a document.
    HTML elements are represented by tags enclosed in angle brackets (<>), and they can contain text, images, links,
    forms, and other types of content.</p>

    <h3>6. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h3> <p>CSS is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation and layout
    of HTML documents. It allows web developers to control the appearance of elements on webpages, including aspects
    such as typography, colors, spacing, positioning, and responsiveness. CSS stylesheets can be applied internally
    within HTML documents, externally as separate files, or inline within specific HTML elements.</p>
